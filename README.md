# Robus
Robus, the robust RObot BUS

Build robots is a really cool things but really complex, you will need really good knowledge in electronics design, mechanical design, low level, and high level programming.
**Pollen Robotics want to simplify it.**

##Robus objectives
Robus allow anyone to build his own robot whatever the level he have. This is possible by using an unified architecture dedicated to robotics allowing to combine a big range of modules easily.
If the technology you need is not already available on the Robus module list, no problem, Robus allow you to design your own using conception tools (like this lib).
Robus hve been created to be easily connected to any exixtent system or device. You will be able to control your robot trought wifi using your computer or trought Bluetooth using your tablet. Your robot can also control your connected objects or other robot system such as Lego mindstorm or Robotis motors.
You can manage you robot using Arduino style low level code, high level language such as python, or both to have the perfect combination between performance and mantainability.

To continue to discover this system corespondantly to your needs, how do you want to use Robus?

> I just want to realize my ideas by creating my robot quikly.

You will probably just need to use standard module and high level programing interface such as Scratch or Python.
Follow [this tutorials](extra/doc/beginers.md).

> I want to create my robot and mastering with presision his behavior.

You will need to combine high level programming langage such as Scratch or Python and low level embeded code.
Robus allow you to create low level behavior localized on specific module and acess it easily using high level languages.
Follow [this tutorial](extra/doc/experimented.md) to learn how.

> My needs are very specific, I want to make my own modules.

You will need to understand how to create your hown module and how Robus work for debugging.
Follow [this tutorial](extra/doc/developers.md).



On Mac you will nedd to install 2 more things : 
`brew install coreutils`
`brew install crosstool-ng`
