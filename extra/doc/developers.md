Robus standard module is not enough, you masterize low level language and want to create your own module.
This is the good way for you.

Robus allow you to concretize your ideas and give you some tools to create your own module such as : 
 - Developpement boards arduino compatible
 - Flexible hardware custom architecture
 - In-situ network debugging
 - A labelisation service to officialize your module into the Robus ecosystem

To begin you will need to understand [what can you do with Robus](whatRobus.md) and [how the Robus protocol work](howRobus.md).
